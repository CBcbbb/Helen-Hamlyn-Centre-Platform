M001,Critical User Forums  ,"Workshops, forums and design session involving direct interaction between design teams and a mixed group of users with severe disabilities. Typical forums consist of roughly 4 - 7 people with different disabilities. Over the course of the session a range of scenarios are explored to assist with the design and development of the artwork, product and/or output. ","1. Recognise exclusion (who are excluded, and why)
2. Identify critical users you intend to reach to gain insights for inclusion and innovation
3. Hosting a forum with key critical users. In these sessions you'll co-create solutions to improve inclusivity (e.g. a participatory process, and a more inclusive intervention) 
4. Reflection  (e.g. on the early decision, the process, and the outcome, what can be learned, and what can be improved) 
5. Revise, re-engage, and re-centre those previously excluded.","Difficulties in identifying critical users

M002,Cultural Probes ,"The cultural probes are tailored packages of maps, postcards, cameras (they are increasingly replaced by smart phones) and other items given to users in local or remote test sites for their responses. Researchers purposefully left their requests vague, ambiguous, and even absurd in order to evoke free and imaginative responses from the participants. The probes are used to pursue a design approach seeking inspiration, and they can also be designed for data collection. The cultural probe packages are often designed with openness and aesthetics. When the packs are returned by the participants, researchers tent to use them continuously as living reminders of the sites, with individual items spurring-on or serving as resources for their design. Cultural probes can provide rich inspirational materials, when combined with interviews, they spark intense conversation/dialogue with the participants.

M003,Personas ,"Personas are user profiles based on research; they provide a synthetic, schematic description of users as the potential recipients of new design concepts. Personas are based on raw data collected from research, but it is not a description of an actual real user. Instead it is the construction of an “ideal typical” profile that clusters meaningful characteristics of people as described by the raw data. To inspire designers, personas must contain subtle information about people’s behaviour and attitudes. More than just a list of functional characteristics of a person (his or her abilities or disabilities), personas should describe people’s value and attitudes, their psychological profile, their domestic environment, their lifestyle, and so on. The profile may also contain description of relations with others, such as a family, colleagues and friends. Often, several personas are created for the development team to consider. ",,,,,,
M004,Scenarios ,"Scenarios can be used to describe current or future use contexts. Scenarios illustrate stories that put the people who use or will use products and services in different contexts. Typically, scenarios are founded on observation; they bind the personal, social and technological aspects of product and service use, thus helping prevent professionals making assumptions based on their own, limited experience. Because most products and services have different kinds of users, each with their own concerns, three or four different scenarios constructed around different characters are often needed to cover the scope of product or service interactions. Scenarios may be presented as texts, storyboards, videos, plays etc. Beyond the design team, scenarios help communicate design concepts and user issues among teams of professionals from different disciplines. Scenarios can be used to communicate concepts either within an organisation or for evaluation with potential users.",,,,,,
M005,Workshops ,"Workshops are flexible collaborative sessions (can be organised in person or online), often between 2 hours to 2 days, using various tools (e.g., visual materials, worksheets, miro boards) to engage stakeholders, explore ideas, make decisions, or tackle specific issues/gather insights. Planning and facilitation are important. ",,,,,,
M006,Role Playing ,"To experience difficulties or problems faced by certain user groups, developers may role play those users. Also known as simulation, empathic research or empathetic experience, this form of first-person experience and data gathering allows the developers to understand not just the physical use of products and spaces, but how the individual feels emotionally and socially in situations and tasks. ",,,,,,
M007,Mapping ,"Mapping is a method using (often visual) diagrams (e.g. concept mapping, mind mapping) to organise, structure, and understand complex information, often starting with a central idea and branching out with related keywords, images, and colours to reveal connections/relationships, aid problem-solving or facilitate learning. ",,,,,,
M008,Individual interviews ,"One-to-one interviews provide information about individual actions and motivations that cannot be obtained in group discussions. An individual interview is a conversation between a researcher and a respondent selected according to agreed criteria of age, lifestyle, etc. It typically lasts an hour or two (make sure breaks are allowed when needed) and may take place in any agreed setting. Walking interviews are increasingly becoming popular. Individual interviews are an important complement to focus groups. Individual interviews are particularly suitable for discussing: sensitive issues such as redundancy or medical problems and cases where individuality is of prime importance, such as financial services. They are to be preferred in cases where the “memory amalgam” that emerges from group discussions would provide information that is less “real” than individual accounts. A case in point is where one wishes to reconstruct a user’s or purchaser’s decision-making process. They are also good with “difficult” interviewees, whether because they are widely geographically spread or because they are strongly opinionated. The interviewer must be skilled and sensitive. Social and listening skills, awareness of body language, self-awareness of the interviewer’s own prejudices, and knowing when and how to draw out or challenge the interviewee are all important.

M009,Mockups and Rapid Prototyping ,"This is a way of making realistic models/mock-ups/rigs/prototypes of product concepts quickly so that can be tested by the team, clients, and users. Rapid prototyping provides a convincing and tangible idea of what a final product could look and feel like. Models can be used for limited physical testing and to gain users’ impressions. Developers can refine models progressively based on user feedback from the previous model to reach an optimum design. 3D printing can be used but cardboard and other readily available materials are equally effective. The ability to make many and varied models makes it profitable to involve users more closely and earlier during product development: the users give more useful reactions to a physical representation of a potential product than to designers’ questions or sketches. It may, however, be necessary to take steps to counter people’s tendency to regard a solid object, far more than a sketch on paper, as something they cannot change, so rough mock-ups rather than refined porotypes can be helpful in early stages.",,,,,,
M010 ,Focus Groups,"Focus groups are used to gather raw data from people to identify user needs in the concept development phase. They can also be used for clarifying particular issues during a design phase and as an evaluation method. The result is usually a list of agreed (and disagreed) statements. With help of a good moderator, a discussion can reveal not only explicit but also implicit needs and reactions. This method is often recommended as a complementary one to interviews and observation. Some key issues for a successful meeting are carefully selecting and preparing participants, good preparation for the meeting, creating a democratic, supportive and informal atmosphere (e.g., refreshments are often provided), and skilful moderation of the discussion. Attention must be paid also to the individual needs of different users considering, for example, their diet and accessibility needs. Research suggests that groups of six to eight people are likely to raise most of the important issues between them, but sometimes larger numbers of participants representing different viewpoints can be fruitful, depending on the issue at hand. It may be desirable to include “critical users” representing the extremes of the user group to ensure inclusive design. Designers often use visual materials and physical models in group sessions, turning them into an interactive workshop.",,,,,,
M011,Observation ,"Observation is a common method used by design researchers, through by watching and recording behaviours, sites/events, or phenomena in their natural or controlled settings, providing insights into what people do, not just what they say they do. It is used in both qualitative (in-depth understanding) and quantitative (frequency counts) studies, and includes types like naturalistic (e.g. Fly on the wall), participant, and controlled observation, allowing researchers to gain real-world data.",,,,,,
M012,Co-design,"Co-design is a collaborative, participatory method where diverse stakeholders (e.g., end-users with lived experience), work together as equal partners to share experience and insights, sharing decision-making, and creating solutions. It is more than consultation, involving deep engagement in inquiry, ideation, prototyping, and implementation, using tools like visual materials (e.g. cards), workshops and journey mapping to foster shared understanding and co-ownership. Effective co-design materials help facilitate effective interaction with the participants.",,,,,,
