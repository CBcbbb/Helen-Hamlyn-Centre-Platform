PR004,Design Bugs Out ,"Launched in August 2008, Design Bugs Out was a design challenge run in partnership with the Department of Health and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency. It brought designers and manufacturers together with clinical specialists, patients and frontline staff to help combat infections by making hospital furniture and equipment easier and quicker to clean. Design Council identified 51 design opportunities with a project Expert Reference Group and Advisory Board, and shortlisted ten opportunities in two streams: five ‘quick wins’ that were developed by the Helen Hamlyn Centre at the Royal College of Art, and five were advertised via a national design competition (e.g., Brunel won two out of the five competitions and developed the commode and patient chair with PearsonLloyd and Kirton Healthcare) ",,"products on market, and publications ",,,"Role playing, scenario building, personas, rapid prototyping  ",https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/archive/reports-resources/design-bugs-out/,"Design Council, Department of Health, NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency, Helen Hamlyn Centre at Royal College of Art, Brunel University, PearsoLloyd, Kirton Healthcare etc "
PR005,Future Ambulance projects ,"Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design has collaborated with partners on several projects to develop future ambulance. Design For Patient Safety: Future Ambulance (2005-6) was initiated by the NHS National Patient Safety Agency, to investigate how the safety of patients and ambulance staff could be improved through better design of vehicles and equipment. Smart Pods Project (2007-09, funded by EPSRC) addressed the whole system of emergency and urgent pre-hospital care. It brought together research by clinicians, designers, social scientists, ergonomists, and operations management analysts, and resulted in a range of innovative propositions that enable clinicians to take healthcare to the community and reduce patient journeys and hospital admissions. Redesign of the current A&E ambulance (2010-11) included input from patients, the public, frontline clinical staff, healthcare managers, operational managers, commissioners and purchasers in an intensive co-design and development programme to produce a redesigned A&E ambulance fit for purpose in the 21st Century.",,,,,"mapping, interview, workshops, scenarios, role play  ",https://www.rca.ac.uk/research-innovation/projects/redesigning-ambulance/ ;  https://rca-media2.rca.ac.uk/documents/122.Redesigning_theEmergency_Ambulance.pdf,"Partners include Royal College of Art Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design and Vehicle Design Department, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust St Mary’s Hospital London, University of the West of England, Ambulance Service NHS Trust.

PR006,Public Toilets Research Unit ,"Two research projects - RATs and TACT3 - have engaged the views of more than 120 members of the public and providers of toilet facilities. By working with these two user groups, researchers at the HHCD have identified a shared problem that design can address, namely the management of information on service provision. The result is The Great British Public Toilet Map, a web-based resource that provides information for users and providers on publicly accessible toilets, and a spin-off company that we hope will be of benefit to the wider community.

PR007,DBA Design Challenges ,"Organised annually since 2000 for ten years by the Royal College of Art’s Helen Hamlyn Centre and the Design Business Association, the DBA Design Challenges invited designers to create products and services that improve the quality of life for disabled and older people. Shortlisted designers – usually six out of about 18 entries – spent a month working with a panel of disabled and elderly mentors, who tested ideas and advise designers.

PR010,Welcoming Workplace / Life of Work / Wellbeing & Workplace,"The Work & City Lab was established in HHCD in 2006 as a hub for workplace design research, bringing a novel academic perspective to understanding and supporting human interaction and experience at work. Research in the form of art and design interventions can be summarised as exploring the impact of design in four areas: influencing behaviour, enhancing experience, exploring sensation and affecting wellbeing. These human-centred perspectives present a design alternative to engineering-led efficiency in the office. The research programme has collaborated with more than 20 commercial organisations and research council funded projects, resulting in ‘3Cs’ (Concentration, Collaboration and Contemplation) office design recommendations and adoption.

This body of research also paved the way for further projects in design and neurodivergence, in collaboration with organisations such as Paintings in Hospitals, St Andrews Healthcare, The hub, Believe in Us, Streests for Diversity ( Rees Jeffreys Road fund), Space in Mind and a scoping study for PAS 6463 ( British Standards Institution), among others.",Mainly how to co-design with individuals with learning disabilties and limited verbal speech and the ethical consdierations of desiging with vulnerable indivduals ,,This is probably the HHCD’s first project exploring co-design methods with neurodivergent people who also had additional learning disabilities and limited speech. The process of designing with people for whom language isn’t the main means of communicating was fascinating. It was also a valuable opportunity to learn how to build trust and connect empathetically with individuals who experience the world very differently from the majority. ,,"Autism at Kingood
